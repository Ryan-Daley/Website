Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! My name is Ryan and I'm an Applied Data Science graduate with a passion for turning data into actionable insights. On this website, you'll find examples of my work in data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning. I am always looking for new opportunities to use my skills to make an impact, so please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss a potential project. Thank you for visiting!

Previously, I received my master's degree in [Applied Data Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg01389/1/msc-applied-data-science) at the [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/) and bachelor's degree in [International Relations & Politics](https://www.port.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate/ba-hons-international-relations-and-politics) at the [University of Portsmouth](https://www.port.ac.uk/).
